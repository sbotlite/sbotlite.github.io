	<p>Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists.<br> 
	To do so, Sbotlite automatically retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that,the bot<br>
	was used to data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">Biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on
	the submissions.</p>

	<p>Sbotlite was developed by Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>

	<p>Below you can see the results of our analysis of 1000 papers </p>

	<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Here we can see the number of articles that were tagged as either Male,<br>  
		   Female, Ambiguous or Unknown. Unknown names could not be identified in any corpus that we used, <br> 
		   and Ambiguous names were equally likely to be male or female.We chose to retweet both female<br> 
		   and ambiguous names with Sbotlite! We also used a Pearson Chi Square test (Chi-square(3) = 165.93, p < 0.001) <br> 
		   to determine that we would be highly unlikely to find this result purely by chance,in other words, <br> 
		   if all categories were equally represented.</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> This figure shows us how many articles were tweeted for each of bioarxiv<br> 
		   subject categories across 1000 articles. It is important to note that not all articles we   <br>
		  analyzed had subject labels!</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> In this figure we visualize the number of articles with Male,Female<br> 
		   ,Ambiguous and Unknown first authors as a functionof time. Each tick on the x-axis is,<br>
		    a new day and a new opportunity for equal representation!</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The final figure shows the number of articles published by first authors<br> 
		   ,broken down by gender and subject.Our statistical analysis revealed a significant effect <br> 
		   of preprint subject (Chi-square(3) = 610.44, p < 0.001).With tools like Sbotlite, it shouldn't<br>
		   be too hard to make this trend significant!</p>
