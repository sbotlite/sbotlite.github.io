	<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hi there, I'm Sbotlite! </h1>

	<p>Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists.<br> 
	To do so, Sbotlite automatically retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that,the bot<br>
	was used to data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">Biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on
	the submissions.</p>

<div>
	<p>Sbotlite was developed by Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>

	<p>Below you can see the results of our analysis of 1000 papers </p>

	<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Here we can see the number of articles that were tagged<br>  
		   as either Male, Female, Ambiguous or Unknown. Unknown names<br> 
		   could not be identified in any corpus we that used, and <br> 
		   Ambiguous names were equally likely to be male or female.<br> 
		   We chose to retweet both female and ambiguous names with<br> 
		   Sbotlite! We also used a Pearson Chi Square test<br> 
		   (Chi-square(3) = 165.93, p < 0.001) to determine that we would<br> 
		   be highly unlikely to find this result purely by chance,<br>
		   in other words, if all categories were equally represented.</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> This figure shows us how many articles were tweeted<br> 
		   for each of bioarxiv subject categories across 1000 articles. It is important<br>
		   to note that not all articles we analyzed had subject labels!</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> In this figure we visualize the number of articles with Male,<br> 
		   Female, Ambiguous and Unknown first authors as a functionof time. Each tick on the<br>
		   x-axis is a new day, and a new opportunity for equal representation!</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The final figure shows the number of articles<br> 
		   published by first authors, broken down by gender and subject.<br> 
		   Our statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of preprint subject<br>
		   (Chi-square(3) = 610.44, p < 0.001).With tools like Sbotlite, it shouldn't<br> 
		   be too hard to make this trend significant!</p>
