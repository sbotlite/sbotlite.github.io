title: Sbotlite, shining the light on women in science
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sbotlite!</h1>
	<p>Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists. 
		To do so, Sbotlite automatically retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that, the bot was used to 
		data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">Biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on the submissions.
	</p>
	<p>Below you can see the results of our analysis of a 1000 papers <\p>
	<p>Sbotlite was developed by Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>
	<p>The link to the Twitter account can be found at: <a href="https://twitter.com/sbotlite">Sbotlite</a></p>

	<p>Figure 1: Here we can see the number of articles that were tagged as either Male, Female, Ambiguous or Unknown. 
		Unknown names could not be identified in any corpus we that used, and Ambiguous names were equally likely to be 
		male or female. We chose to retweet both female and ambiguous names with Sbotlite! We also used a Pearson Chi 
		Square test to determine that we would be highly unlikely to find this result purely by chance, in other words,
		if all categories were equally represented.</p>
