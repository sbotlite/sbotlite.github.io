	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sbotlite!</h1>
	<p>Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists. 
		To do so, Sbotlite retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that, the bot was used to 
		data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on the submissions.
	</p>
	<p>The development team behind Sbotlite is composed of Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>
