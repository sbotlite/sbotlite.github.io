		Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists. 
		To do so, Sbotlite automatically retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that,the bot
		was used to data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">Biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on
		the submissions.</p>

		<p>Sbotlite was developed by Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>

		<p>Below you can see the results of our analysis of 1000 papers. Additionally, Sbotlite tweets statistics on
		the gender of 1st authors of biorxiv papers. Currently, the statistics tweeted is the number of detected female first author
			divided by the sum of detected female first authors and detected male first authors.

		<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Here we can see the number of articles that were tagged as either Male, Female, Ambiguous  
			   or Unknown. Unknown names could not be identified in any corpus that we used, and Ambiguous names were equally 
			   likely to be male or female. We chose to retweet both female and ambiguous names with Sbotlite! 
			   We also used a Pearson Chi Square test (Chi-square(3) = 165.93, p < 0.001)  to determine that we would be highly 
			   to find this result purely by chance,in other words,if all categories were equally represented.

		<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> This figure shows us how many articles were tweeted for each of bioarxiv subject categories across 1000 articles. It is important to note that not all articles we analyzed had subject labels!

		<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> In this figure we visualize the number of articles with Male, Female, Ambiguous 
			    or Unknown first authors as a function of time. Each tick on the x-axis is a new day and a new 
			    opportunity for equal representation!

		<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The final figure shows the number of articles published by first authors broken down 
			   by gender and subject.Our statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of preprint subject 
			   (Chi-square(3) = 610.44, p < 0.001).With tools like Sbotlite, it shouldn't be too hard to make this 
			   trend significant!</p>
