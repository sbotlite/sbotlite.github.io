	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sbotlite! <img src="sbotlite_logo.001.png" alt="sbotlight logo" width="1024" height="768"></h1>
	<p>Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists. 
		To do so, Sbotlite automatically retweets papers from biorxiv with female first authors. On top of that, the bot was used to 
		data mine the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">Biorxiv</a> archives and produce analysis on the submissions.
	</p>
	
	<p>Sbotlite was developed by Vassiki Chauhan, Jean-Hugues Lestang and Sushmita Sadhukha.</p>

	<p>Below you can see the results of our analysis of a 1000 papers </p>

	<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Here we can see the number of articles that were tagged 
		as either Male, Female, Ambiguous or Unknown. Unknown names 
		could not be identified in any corpus we that used, and 
		Ambiguous names were equally likely to be male or female. 
		We chose to retweet both female and ambiguous names with Sbotlite! 
		We also used a Pearson Chi Square test (Chi-square(3) = 165.93, p < 0.001) 
		to determine that we would be highly unlikely to find this result purely 
		by chance, in other words, if all categories were equally represented.</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> This figure shows us how many articles were tweeted for each of bioarxiv 
		subject categories across 1000 articles. It is important to note that
		not all articles we analyzed had subject labels!</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> In this figure we visualize the number of articles with Male, 
		Female, Ambiguous and Unknown first authors as a function
		of time. Each tick on the x-axis is a new day, and a new 
		opportunity for equal representation!</p>
	<p></p>

	<p><img src="label_subject.png" alt="label subjects" width="1334" height="1000"></p>
	<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The final figure shows the number of articles published by
		first authors, broken down by gender and subject. Our statistical
		analysis revealed a significant effect of gender (Chi-square(27) = 156, p < 0.001)
		and subject (Chi-square(3) = 627, p < 0.001). However, the combined effect of 
		gender and subject was not significant (Chi-square(67) = 86, p = 0.06), 
		suggesting that male names dominate across all subjects. However, with tools
		like Sbotlite, it shouldn't be too hard to make this trend significant!</p>
