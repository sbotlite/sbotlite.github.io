Sbotlite is a twitter bot whose mission is to investigate gender bias in science and promote women scientists. To do so, Sbotlite retweets papers from [Biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) with female first authors. On top of that, the bot was used to data mine the biorxiv archives and produce analysis on the submissions.
